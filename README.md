## Overview

Paperboy is complete email engine that helps you get the most out of your
campaigns. It allows you to craft shared templates, and then quickly author
and deliver multi-format campaigns.

Paperboy is command-line tool that consumes a [source directory][structure]
as input to render and send email campaigns via any SMTP service.  By placing
templates, lists, and content in a predefined [directory structure][structure],
Paperboy will render markup, inline styles, wrap layouts, and more to deliver
modern (yet legacy-compatible) newsletters and announcements.

**Complete documentation is available at [Paperboy Documentation][docs].**

## Installing binaries

Currently, we provide [pre-built binaries][releases] for Linux and macOS.
Paperboy is a single binary with no external dependencies.

Just run `./paperboy help` and you're [ready to go][quickstart].

## Installing from source

You can also build and install Paperboy from source. The only requirement is to
have a working installation of [Go][] 1.11+. With those in place, the following
commands will install Paperboy to `$GOPATH/bin`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rykov/paperboy.git
$ cd paperboy
$ make install
```

And please make sure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

If you receive a `go: modules disabled` error due to your project being inside
of $GOPATH, you will have to force-enable go modules support:

```bash
GO111MODULE=on make install
```

## Inspiration and credits

Paperboy aims to bring to email the ease of use and control we love from static
site generators. We particularly want to thank [Hugo][] authors for much of
the inspiration and a number of our [dependencies][].
